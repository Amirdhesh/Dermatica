## Model Details

Dermatica leverages a pre-trained ResNet model for the identification of dermatological diseases. This model, built with TensorFlow, is specifically tailored for processing dermatological images and making accurate predictions based on the learned patterns.

## Dataset
The model was trained on a diverse dataset available at Dermnet Dataset on Kaggle. This dataset encompasses various skin conditions, enabling the model to generalize well across different disease categories.

## Model Architecture
The underlying architecture utilizes ResNet50, a powerful deep learning model known for its ability to capture intricate features in images. Additional layers, including Global Average Pooling and Dense layers, were added to facilitate the classification of skin conditions.
